# 🧩 Web Development Selection Task — GDG on Campus (2025–26)

Welcome to the **Web Development Selection Task** for GDG on Campus!  
Your challenge is to build a **Kanban Board** using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks or external libraries.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Create a simple **Kanban Board** that helps users manage their tasks in 3 columns:
- **To Do**
- **In Progress**  
- **Done**

You'll get a basic folder structure — and here's the twist 👀  
👉 You must work within this structure only.  
**No adding or removing files/folders.**

---

## 🧱 Folder Structure (Provided)

```
/assets
  style.css
  script.js
index.html
README.md
```

**Note:**  
- Modify these files only. Don't create new ones.

---

## 🧠 What is a Kanban Board?

A **Kanban Board** is a simple project management tool that visualizes your work in progress.  
Each task moves through stages like **To Do → In Progress → Done**, helping teams stay organized and track progress easily.  
You'll be building a small version of it using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

---

## 🧩 Task Requirements

1. Create **three columns** — To Do, In Progress, and Done.
2. Display **task cards** (like "Finish GDG design", "Fix bug", etc.) in the columns.
3. Allow users to **move tasks between columns** (via drag-and-drop or buttons).
4. **Style it neatly** — clean, readable, and user-friendly.
5. Use **vanilla JS** for logic — no frameworks.

---

## 🎨 Bonus (Optional)

- Add a small **"+" button** to add a new task.
- **Save changes** using localStorage so tasks stay after page reload.
- Add **hover effects**, color coding, or smooth transitions.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Submission

1. Upload your completed project to **GitHub** (public repository).
2. Share your **GitHub repo link** via the form provided.
3. **Deadline** will be announced in the group — make sure to submit on time!
